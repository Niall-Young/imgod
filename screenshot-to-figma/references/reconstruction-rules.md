# Screenshot Reconstruction Rules

## Screenshot Analysis Checklist

Capture these facts before writing HTML:

- Canvas and viewport: screenshot dimensions, likely device class, scroll state, safe areas, and background treatment.
- Layout: main regions, grids, columns, alignment anchors, spacing rhythm, content density, and fixed or sticky areas.
- Visual system: color roles, typography scale, font weight, line height, radius, borders, shadows, translucency, blur, gradients, and elevation.
- Components: nav, buttons, inputs, cards, tabs, toggles, tables, menus, modals, charts, media blocks, badges, and empty/loading/error states when visible.
- Content: exact visible text where legible; preserve line breaks and truncation patterns.
- Assets: photos, illustrations, thumbnails, logos, mascots/IP, icons, avatars, and background textures.
- Interactions: hover affordances, selected state, active/click feedback, disabled styling, focus rings, expanded/collapsed state, and scroll-triggered behavior.

## HTML Reconstruction Rules

- Create one standalone HTML file per screenshot unless the user asks for multiple pages.
- Prefer semantic HTML with inline CSS in a `<style>` tag and minimal vanilla JS in a `<script>` tag.
- Match the screenshot first; avoid adding explanatory text, onboarding copy, or controls that are not visible or implied.
- Treat the screenshot as the default and only source of truth. Do not browse the original site, fetch production assets, or use external brand files unless the user explicitly provides or requests those sources.
- Use CSS variables for repeated colors, radii, shadows, and spacing when it helps keep the page coherent.
- Use real text and HTML controls instead of flattening UI to images.
- Do not recreate logos, customer marks, badges, mascots, illustrations, photos, or product imagery as live DOM text. Create separate image assets and insert them with `<img>`.
- Do not hand-draw brand marks, mascots, illustrations, thumbnails, product images, or brand-specific pictorial icons as rough SVG approximations. Crop/extract from the screenshot, use user-supplied assets, use image generation, or rasterize the extracted result into image assets instead.
- Give fixed-format UI elements stable dimensions with `width`, `height`, `aspect-ratio`, grid tracks, or `min/max` constraints so states do not cause layout shift.
- Avoid placeholder rectangles. If the screenshot contains visual content and no source asset is available, generate or approximate the asset.
- Keep generated pages local and self-contained enough that browser capture works without a framework dev server when possible.

## Component State Requirements

Implement stateful components with CSS and small JS where needed:

- Buttons and icon buttons: default, `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus-visible`, and `[disabled]`.
- Inputs and textareas: default, hover/focus, filled, invalid if visible, placeholder, and disabled.
- Tabs/nav/segmented controls: default, hover, active/selected, and disabled where applicable.
- Cards/list rows: default, hover or selected if clickable, pressed if the screenshot implies click behavior.
- Toggles/checkboxes/radios: checked, unchecked, disabled, focus-visible.
- Dropdowns/menus/modals: closed and open behavior if visible or expected from the screenshot.

Use `data-state`, `aria-selected`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, or native attributes to make state explicit and easy for Figma capture to interpret.

## Hugeicons Rules

- Use Hugeicons as the default icon source: https://hugeicons.com/ and https://docs.hugeicons.com/.
- Use inline SVG icons copied from Hugeicons documentation or package output so the HTML remains portable.
- Every icon instance must contain its full SVG geometry directly in place, for example `<svg ...><path ...></path></svg>`.
- Do not use `<symbol>`, `<use href="#...">`, SVG sprites, icon fonts, web components, external icon scripts, or CDN-only references. Figma html-to-design often cannot resolve them and imports empty icon boxes.
- Match icon size, stroke width, cap/join style, and optical alignment to the screenshot.
- If an exact icon is unavailable, choose the nearest semantic and visual match from Hugeicons.
- Do not mix in Lucide, Heroicons, Font Awesome, Material Icons, emoji, or custom hand-drawn icon systems unless the user explicitly asks.
- If an icon is part of a brand illustration, logo, mascot, product image, or screenshot-specific pictorial art, treat it as an image asset instead of a generic Hugeicons UI icon.

## Image Generation Rules

Use image2/image generation when the screenshot includes an asset that is not supplied as a cutout or extractable image.

Required prompt core from the skill owner:

```text
最大深度的去理解图片上的界面样式，高精度还原组件的效果，要求样式与交互与组件保持一致。同时保证每个组件都具有可交互性(默认、鼠标移入、点击、禁用)。
```

For mascots/IP characters, extend the prompt:

```text
界面上的吉祥物 IP 保留为单独的透明底图片，替换进 HTML 页面；保持吉祥物动作、姿态、表情、比例、风格、光照和边缘处理的一致性。
```

For missing illustrations or photos:

```text
当没有切图时，使用 image2 图片生成器生成对应的图片内容，例如吉祥物、IP、视觉插画等；保持与截图一致的风格、色彩、透视、光照和精细度，不添加截图中没有的文字。
```

Save generated assets beside the HTML, use descriptive filenames, and embed them with `<img>` tags. For transparent mascots, prefer PNG/WebP with alpha and validate that corners are transparent.

## Logo and Brand Mark Rules

- Logos and customer marks are image assets. Never leave them as editable page text, even if the mark is word-only.
- If a supplied or extracted logo source is SVG with embedded fonts, `<text>`, complex paths, or effects that Figma capture may split into poor layers, rasterize it to a transparent PNG/WebP and use that bitmap in the HTML.
- Priority order:
  1. Use a supplied original logo/cutout if the user provides one.
  2. Crop or extract the mark from the screenshot when the resolution is sufficient.
  3. Use image generation or deterministic raster/vector generation to create a separate logo-like image asset matching the screenshot.
- Insert each mark with `<img src="...">` and fixed dimensions that match the screenshot.
- Keep transparent backgrounds unless the screenshot shows a filled logo tile.
- If the exact trademark asset cannot be recovered, report that the logo is a visually matched approximation.
- Do not use HTML text styled with CSS as the final logo implementation; Figma will import it as text, not as a logo asset.

## Browser Verification

Before capture:

- Open the HTML at the screenshot's approximate viewport size.
- Take or inspect a rendered screenshot and compare it against the original.
- Check that text does not overflow controls and that hover/active/disabled states do not shift layout.
- Confirm images load, fonts are ready, SVG icons render, and no visible broken assets remain.
- Scroll through long pages once to trigger lazy content before running capture.

## Figma Capture Rules

- Use `assets/capture-for-design.js` without changing the capture sequence.
- Keep `selector: "body"` by default.
- Treat the capture result as an HTML clipboard payload, not readable user text.
- The payload should begin with `<span data-h2d="<!--(figh2d)` and must be copied to Figma as MIME type `text/html`.
- Save the payload as `figma-capture.txt` next to the HTML for traceability.
- Do not tell users to manually select/copy the visible contents of `figma-capture.txt`; that produces a giant text layer in Figma.
- On macOS, prefer `swift scripts/copy_figma_payload_to_clipboard.swift <figma-capture.txt>` and verify `clipboard info` includes `«class HTML»`.
- If browser clipboard copy is needed, open a helper page through `http://127.0.0.1`, not `file://`; `file://` pages often fail or degrade clipboard writes.
- Report any remaining mismatch honestly, such as unavailable exact font, inferred hidden state, or generated image differences.
