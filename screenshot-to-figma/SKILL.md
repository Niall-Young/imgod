description: Convert UI screenshots into Figma-pasteable design captures by first writing a design.md UI specification, then reconstructing the screenshot as a high-fidelity Vite React app with Hugeicons React icons and generated image assets when needed, running Figma Code to Canvas capture, and copying the text/html payload to the clipboard. Use when the user provides a UI screenshot and asks to turn it into a Figma design, convert a screenshot to Figma, recreate UI for Figma, generate HTML-to-Figma paste content, or restore a screenshot as editable Figma layers.

# IMG to figma

## Overview

Use this skill to turn a user-provided UI screenshot into an editable Figma design through three steps: write `design.md`, rebuild the UI as a local React app, then run Figma Code to Canvas capture and copy the resulting `text/html` payload to the clipboard. Do not directly create or modify Figma files; deliver the capture through an HTML clipboard write or a paste helper page so Figma receives `text/html`, not plain text.

For detailed reconstruction standards, read `references/reconstruction-rules.md` before writing `design.md` or implementing the React app.

## Required Workflow

1. Inspect the input screenshot and create `design.md` before writing UI code. Include canvas size, layout grid, component hierarchy, text content, colors, typography, spacing, imagery, Hugeicons mapping, image-generation needs, and visible interaction affordances.
2. Create a Vite React project for the reconstruction unless the user explicitly requests a different React setup. Use JavaScript JSX by default and include `react`, `react-dom`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@hugeicons/react`, and `@hugeicons/core-free-icons`.
3. Implement the screenshot as interactive React UI, not static pixels. Include default, hover, active/click, focus where relevant, and disabled states for buttons, inputs, tabs, cards, nav items, toggles, menus, and other controls.
4. Use Hugeicons React packages for all generic UI icons. Import `HugeiconsIcon` from `@hugeicons/react` and icon definitions from `@hugeicons/core-free-icons`; choose the closest matching Hugeicons icon for every icon-like glyph. Do not hand-inline Hugeicons SVG, use SVG sprites, icon fonts, external icon scripts, or CDN-only references.
5. For missing raster or visual assets, generate or derive images rather than using blank placeholders:
   - Assume the user only provided the screenshot. Do not fetch the original website/app assets, inspect the live product, or rely on external brand files unless the user explicitly provides a URL/source asset or asks you to use external sources.
   - Treat logos, brand marks, customer marks, badges, mascots, illustrations, photos, and product shots as image assets, not DOM text or CSS-only approximations.
   - For logos/brand marks, create separate image files and insert them with `<img>`. Prefer a crop/cutout from the supplied screenshot when available; otherwise generate or rasterize a logo-like image asset that visually matches the screenshot.
   - Do not substitute brand marks, mascots, illustrations, thumbnails, product images, or brand-specific pictorial icons with rough hand-authored SVG. If a supplied/extracted source is SVG but contains embedded fonts/text or complex illustration, rasterize it to PNG/WebP before capture so Figma imports it as a faithful image asset instead of decomposed low-quality vectors or editable text.
   - Use image2/image generation for mascots, IP characters, illustrations, banners, thumbnails, product imagery, or visual art that is present in the screenshot but not supplied as a cutout.
   - Keep mascots/IP as separate transparent-background assets and preserve the screenshot's pose, action, expression, proportions, and style as closely as possible.
6. Start the React dev server, render the app in a browser, compare it against the screenshot, and revise until the layout, density, component treatment, and visual hierarchy are acceptably close.
7. Run the capture script from `assets/capture-for-design.js` in the page context after the React app has loaded and fonts/images are ready.
8. Deliver the result as Figma-pasteable `text/html`:
   - Save the captured `text/html` payload as `figma-capture.txt` beside the React project for traceability only.
   - Write that payload to the system clipboard as HTML before the final response when the environment allows it.
   - If direct clipboard writing is unavailable, create or copy an HTTP-served paste helper page that writes the payload with `ClipboardItem({"text/html": ...})`.
   - Always include a concrete copy route in the final response: either "the Figma `text/html` payload is already on your clipboard; paste into Figma now" or a full `http://127.0.0.1:.../figma-paste-helper.html` URL with a button that copies the payload as `text/html`.
   - Never tell the user to open `figma-capture.txt` and manually copy its visible text; Figma will paste that as a giant text layer instead of editable design layers.

## Capture Procedure

Use `assets/capture-for-design.js` as the canonical script. Keep `selector: "body"` unless the user explicitly asks to capture a smaller root.

Recommended browser-console flow:

```javascript
// Paste the contents of assets/capture-for-design.js into the page console.
// The resolved value is the Figma-pasteable capture payload.
```

If browser automation is available, open the local React dev server or preview URL, wait for fonts/images, then evaluate the same script in the page context. Do not rewrite the capture logic ad hoc.

## Clipboard Delivery

Figma Code to Canvas requires the payload to be on the clipboard with MIME type `text/html`. A raw chat message, a text file selection, or a normal plain-text copy is not enough.

After capture:

1. Extract the `text/html` clipboard payload. It should begin with `<span data-h2d="<!--(figh2d)`.
2. Save that exact payload to `figma-capture.txt`.
3. Prefer writing the payload directly to the system clipboard:

```bash
swift scripts/copy_figma_payload_to_clipboard.swift /path/to/figma-capture.txt
```

4. If direct clipboard writing is blocked, serve the output folder over HTTP and use an HTML paste helper page with `navigator.clipboard.write([new ClipboardItem({"text/html": blob})])`. Open it from `http://127.0.0.1:...`, not `file://`.
5. In the final response, say whether the clipboard was written. If it was written, tell the user to paste directly into Figma. If not, provide the HTTP helper URL and explicitly warn not to manually copy the text file contents.

Use `figma-capture.txt` as an artifact/debug file, not as the user copy workflow.

## Output Contract

Return these items at the end of the task:

- The `design.md` path.
- The React project path or dev server URL used for capture.
- The generated asset paths, if any.
- Clipboard status: Figma `text/html` copied, plus the HTTP paste helper URL when one exists. This is the user-facing copyable delivery surface.
- The local `figma-capture.txt` path as a backup artifact only.
- A concise note about any fidelity limitations that remain.
